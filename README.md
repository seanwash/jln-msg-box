# MsgBox App

MsgBox is a tool for viewing the contents of [msg](https://fileinfo.com/extension/msg) files. Currently, it allows you to:

* Import unlimited msg files
* View attachments contained in import msg files
* Search the contents of imported msg

This project is still in early alpha/proof of concept stage and is not to be considered stable. To see what's in the works, you can view the [Beta Project](https://github.com/seanwash/msgbox-app/projects/1).
